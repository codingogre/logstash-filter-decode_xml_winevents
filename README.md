# Decode XML Windows Events (Logstash Plugin)

This is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash).

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

## Documentation

This plugin will decode Windows Events that are formatted as XML.  The output of the filter will conform to the [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html).

The plugin only takes one parameter:  field.  This points to the field in the Logstash event that contains the Windows Event

e.g.
```sh
input {
###
}

filter {
  decode_xml_winevents {
    field => "xmlstring"
  }
}

output {
  stdout { }
}
````


**IMPORTANT**: Since the output will conform to ECS the message field in the Logstash event is copied to event.original and the original Windows Event message is located in winlog.message.
